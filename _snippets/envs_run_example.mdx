<Accordion title="Example">
Copy and save the following contents in a file called `test.sh`.

```
echo DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD
```

Now inject your secrets in the process by running your script with the following command:

  ```
  envs run -- sh test.sh
  ```

  <Info>
  If you get a permission error for your shell-script, just run: `chmod +x test.sh`
  </Info>

  This should ideally produce the following output:

  ```
  DB_PASSWORD=awesome
  ```
