title: Environment Tokens
description: Securely export your secrets in unknown territory.
---

Secrets aren't supposed to be read by only humans. Sometimes, even machines need to fetch and read them. But you can't save your account password in your scripts or CI/CD pipelines, right? That'd be too dangerous.

To solve this issue, envsecrets allows you to generate ephemeral read-only tokens for a specific environment. These tokens allow you to authenticate the CLI against our APIs and export your secrets securely.

Use the following command:

```sh
envs export --token [your-secure-token]
```

## Example

Use the following sample job step in your Github Actions workflow file.

```yaml
name: envs

on:
  push:

jobs:
  run_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Export Secrets
      run: |
          export CLI_VERSION=1.1.7
          wget https://github.com/envsecrets/cli/releases/download/v${CLI_VERSION}/cli_${CLI_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
          tar -xvzf cli_${CLI_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
          chmod +x ./envs
          ./envs export --token b38fd6ef7fd54c53f972c03fe2110ec2 >> $GITHUB_ENV
      shell: bash
    - name: Read Secrets
      run: |
          echo $API_KEY
      shell: bash
```
