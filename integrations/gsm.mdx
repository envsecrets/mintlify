---

## Prerequisites

* You have a [GCP account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and are familiar with GCP Secret Manager
* You have the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and authenticated
* You have [enabled the Secret Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/secretmanager.googleapis.com) for your GCP project

<Note>

Ensure the gcloud CLI is configured to use the correct project, e.g. `gcloud config set project [your-project]` before proceeding.

</Note>


## Setup

1.  **Create new IAM Service Account**



    Run the following commands with the **gcloud** CLI.



    ```bash
    # To narrow permission scope use this prefix for envsecrets accessible secrets.
    SECRET_PREFIX="envsecrets-";

    # Get current project
    PROJECT_ID="$(gcloud config get-value project --quiet)";

    # Create a new Service Account
    gcloud iam service-accounts create envsecrets \
      --description="Service account for envsecrets to sync secrets to Secret Manager" \
      --display-name="envsecrets";

    # Attach SecretManagerAdmin policy to the new service account
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
      --member="serviceAccount:envsecrets@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
      --role="roles/secretmanager.admin" \
      --condition="expression=resource.name.extract(\"secrets/{rest}\").startsWith(\"$SECRET_PREFIX\"),title=\"$SECRET_PREFIX*\"";

    ```


2.  **Create keys for the new service account**



    ```bash
    # Generate a key for your new service account
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create iam-key.json \
      --iam-account="envsecrets@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com";

    # Print (and then remove) the JSON credentials
    cat iam-key.json && rm iam-key.json;
    ```

    &#x20;

    Copy and save the keys printed on your shell.


3. **Configuration**
   1. Go to [integrations catalog](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations/catalog) in your envsecrets dashboard and choose "GCP Secrets Manager."
   2. On the setup/connection page, enter the service account keys you created above and save the form.

<Info>

We will enable "**Automatic Replication**" for your GCP secret by default. You can learn more about this from [GCP Secret Manager replication docs](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/choosing-replication).

</Info>

## Activation

1. Go to the [integrations](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations) dashboard in your envsecrets organisation and under "GCP Secrets Manager" choose "Sync New Environment With Your GCP Secrets Manager Account."
1. In the page that opens, select your envsecrets project, environment and enter the name with which you wish you save your secret in GCP Secrets Manager.
1. Complete and save the form.

## Usage

### Platform

1. Navigate to the environment for which you activated the integration.
1. Click on the "Sync" button.
1. Choose the GSM Secret to which you want to sync your secrets.
1. Approve the sync.

### CLI

1. Use the command: `envs sync --env [name-of-your-remote-environment]`
1. Choose the GSM integration.

<Tip>

Once your secrets are synced, it is recommended you go to your Gitlab repository and validate the new values.

</Tip>
<Warning>

Every new version of your secret in envsecrets will create a new version of the existing secret in GCP Secrets Manager.
