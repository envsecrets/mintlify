# Overview

Our platform smoothly supports integrating third-party services for uni-directional syncing. Implying, every time you update your secrets in envsecrets, the new values will automatically be synced with your external services.

### Example

If you connected a Github Actions integration in your organisation and enabled it on any environment of your project, your secrets will be synced/pushed to your Github repository's Actions secrets. Which, in turn, you can natively access in your Actions/Workflow pipelines.
