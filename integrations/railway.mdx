   1. Go to [your Railway account settings](https://railway.app/account/tokens) and create a new API token.

2. **Configuration**
   1. Go to [integrations catalog](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations/catalog) in your envsecrets dashboard and choose "Railway."
   2. On the setup/connection page, enter your Railway API token you created above and save the configuration.

## Activation

1. Go to the [integrations](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations) dashboard in your envsecrets organisation and under "Railway" choose "Sync New Environment With Your Railway Account."
1. In the page that opens, select your envsecrets project, environment and your Railway project and environment where you wish to push/sync your secrets.
1. Complete and save the form.

## Usage

### Platform

1. Navigate to the environment for which you activated the integration.
1. Click on the "Sync" button.

1. Approve the sync.

### CLI

- RAILWAY_PROJECT_NAME
- RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
- RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME
- RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID
- RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID

- RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT
