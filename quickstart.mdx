## Preprequisites

1. Signup for an [envsecrets account](https://app.envsecrets.com).
2. [Install the CLI](cli/install).

## Setup

Firstly, change directory to your project root.

```
cd my-project
```

## Local Environment

In order to get comfortable, let's first run through all commands in your local environment before we go to remote environment.

Run the following commands in correct order.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your secrets">
  ```
  envs set DB_PASSWORD=awesome
  ```
  This will set your key-value pair locally **without** encrypting the values.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List your secrets">
  ```
  envs ls
  ```
  This will list your locally saved key-value pairs and help you validate that your key-value pair indeed got set.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your secret">
  ```
  envs get DB_PASSWORD
  ```
  This will get the value of key `DB_PASSWORD` from locally saved key-value pairs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consume your secret">
  ```
  envs run -- [start-command-of-your-process]
  ```

<Snippet file="envs_run_example.mdx" />

  This will fetch all the locally available values and inject them into your process.
  You can now access your secrets natively in your code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Remote Environment

- To manage secrets in your remote/hosted environment, you can simply use the same aforementioned commands with `-e` or `--env`.
- For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the pre-initialized/default `prod` environment that is created for your every envsecrets project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login">
  ```
  envs login
  ```

  When prompted, enter your envsecrets account credentials i.e. email and password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initalize the project directory">
  ```
  envs init
  ```

  This command will ask you to choose your organisation, project and one of it's environments.

  If you do not already have a project, you can create one directly from the CLI when prompted with the option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your secrets">
  ```
  envs set DB_PASSWORD=awesome -e prod
  ```
  This will create a new version of your secret in your remote `prod` environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="List your secrets">
  ```
  envs ls -e prod
  ```
  This will list the key-value pairs in the latest secret version of your remote `prod` environment and help you validate that your key-value pair indeed got set.
  <Tip>
  You can use the `--version` flag to modify which version to list the secrets for.
  </Tip>
  <Info>
  If you want to export the values of all the keys and not just list the keys, use: `envs export`
  </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your secret">
  ```
  envs get DB_PASSWORD -e prod
  ```
  This will get the value for key `DB_PASSWORD` in the latest secret version of your remote `prod` environment.
  <Tip>
  You can use the `--version` flag to modify which version to get the value from.
  </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consume your secret">
  ```
  envs run -e prod -- [start-command-of-your-process]
  ```

<Snippet file="envs_run_example.mdx" />

  This will fetch the key-value pairs in the latest secret version of your remote `prod` environment.
  You can now access your secrets natively in your code.
  <Tip>
  You can use the `--version` flag to modify which version to get the values from.
  </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect an Integration

For the sake of this tutorial, let's connect the Github Actions integration.

1. Go to [integrations catalog](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations/catalog) in your envsecrets dashboard and choose "Github Actions."
1. Complete the Oauth procedure that begins and grant access to all of your Github repositories to which you wish to sync your secrets. 
1. Go to the [integrations](https://app.envsecrets.com/integrations) dashboard in your envsecrets organisation and under "Github Actions" choose "Sync New Environment With Your Github Actions Account."
1. In the page that opens, select your envsecrets project, environment and your Github repository where you wish to push/sync your secrets.
1. Complete and save the form.

## Sync Your Secrets

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="laptop" title="From the UI">
  1. Navigate to the environment for which you activated the integration.
  1. Click on the "Sync" button.
  1. Choose the Github repository to which you want to sync your secrets.
  1. Approve the sync.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="terminal" title="From the CLI">

Once your secrets are synced, it is recommended you go to your Github repository and validate the new values.
