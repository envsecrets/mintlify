### User

* Every new user is issued a public-private key pair.

#### Keys Backup

* We encrypt your private key with a separate symmetric "protection" key. This new "protection" key is in turn protected with your account password using [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2), which can derive cryptographic keys from passwords and was selected as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
* Now your public key, encrypted private key, encrypted protection key and hashed account password are stored on our servers.
* Whenever you login from a different machine, your key pair is downloaded from our servers, decrypted locally using your account password and saved in your machine.

### Organisation

* Every new organisation is issued a fresh AES 256 bit symmetric key.&#x20;
* All secrets in this organisation are encrypted with it's key using the industry standard [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html)'s [secretbox package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which uses `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages with secret-key cryptography.

### Collaboration

* When a new member is invited to your organisation, they are issued a copy of the organisation's key encrypted with their own (invitee's) public key using NaCL's [box package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which, in turn uses `Curve25519`, `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages. And this copy is stored on our servers.

## Design

### Authentication

* Running `envs login` from the CLI installs your public-private key pair locally after decrypting it with your account password.
* Running `envs init` in the project root directory, saves the project configuration in that directory along with installing your encrypted copy of the chosen organisation's key.

### Cryptography

* When a member does `envs set KEY=value` from the CLI, their locally stored copy of the organisation's key is first decrypted using their private key, then the secret **value** is encrypted with the decrypted key. This key-value pair is then uploaded on our servers.
* Vice versa, when they do `envs get KEY`, the encrypted secret value is downloaded from our servers and decrypted using the locally stored copy of organisation's encryption key.

## Access Protection

We have carefully implemented very specific row-level and column-level security on our transactional database to ensure only the data and relationships belonging to you are accessible by you. And no one else can gain visibility into your rows.

To validate your access to specific rows and columns, we use the conventional method of reading claims from your post-login identity token.

## Statement

We are seriously committed to providing the best-in-class security and privacy of all our users' data. However, it is important to acknowledge that no system is perfectly secure.

While being passionately committed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our users' secrets, we take all measures within our capacity to fix vulnerabilities in our system, continously strive to increase trust amongst the engineering and developer community vis-a-vis our platform and operations.

If something breaks unintentionally, we take due measures to notify the users and keep updating them until the issue is resolved. Users are also constantly advised to not hesitate in reaching out to us, either on [mail](mailto:wahal@envsecrets.com) or our [community server](https://discord.gg/zaDG5xJd9N), in case something goes wrong.
