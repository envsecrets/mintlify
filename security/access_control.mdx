description: More about our access control and how to customize it.

We have carefully implemented very specific row-level and column-level security on our transactional database to ensure only the data and relationships belonging to you are accessible by you. And no one else can gain visibility into your rows.

To validate your access to specific rows and columns, we use the conventional method of reading claims from your post-login identity token.
