### User

* Every new user is issued a public-private RSA key pair.

#### Keys Backup

- We encrypt your private key with a separate symmetric "protection" key.
This new "protection" key is in turn protected with your account password using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) method which can derive cryptographic keys from passwords and was selected as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
- Now your public key, encrypted private key, encrypted protection key and hashed account password are stored on our servers.
- Whenever you login from a different machine, your key pair is downloaded from our servers, decrypted locally using your account password and saved in your machine.

### Organisation

* Every new organisation is issued a fresh AES 256 bit symmetric key.&#x20;
* All secrets in this organisation are encrypted with it's key using the industry standard [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html)'s [secretbox package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which uses `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages with secret-key cryptography.

### Collaboration

* When a new member is invited to your organisation, they are issued a copy of the organisation's key encrypted with their own (invitee's) public key using NaCL's [box package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which, in turn uses `Curve25519`, `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages. And this copy is stored on our servers.

## Implementation

### Authentication

* Running `envs login` from the CLI installs your public-private key pair locally after decrypting it with your account password.
* Running `envs init` in the project root directory, saves the project configuration in that directory along with installing your encrypted copy of the chosen organisation's key.

### Cryptography

* When a member does `envs set KEY=value` from the CLI, their locally stored copy of the organisation's key is first decrypted using their private key, then the secret **value** is encrypted with the decrypted key. This key-value pair is then uploaded on our servers.
* Vice versa, when they do `envs get KEY`, the encrypted secret value is downloaded from our servers and decrypted using the locally stored copy of organisation's encryption key.
